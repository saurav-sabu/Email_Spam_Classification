## Introduction

Email spam remains a persistent issue in today's digital communication landscape. This project addresses the challenge of spam detection by implementing a machine learning model that classifies emails as either spam or non-spam. The model is trained on a labeled dataset, and its performance is evaluated using various metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains a collection of labeled emails, where each email is marked as spam or non-spam.

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saurav-sabu/Email_Spam_Classification.git
cd Email_Spam_Classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
